# Tic-Tac-Toe using min-max algorithm

This project is a simple yet powerful Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python.
It uses the classic Minimax algorithm to create an AI player that plays perfectly â€” it will never lose!

The code is modular and easy to follow. It covers:

How to represent the board state.

How to check valid moves and generate possible actions.

How to apply moves to the board.

How to check for a winner or a draw.

How to calculate the utility of a game state.

How to use the Minimax algorithm to pick the best move for any given state.

### This project helped me in:

Learning about adversarial search and game trees.

Understanding how AI makes optimal decisions in a zero-sum game.

Practicing clean, functional Python code.

Building a foundation for more advanced AI algorithms.
